The most common examples are the tension headaches, migraines, and headaches associate with medication.  Cluster headaches are less common.",

Additionally, they can be accompanied by nausea and impaired vision and sense of touch (see separate article on migraines).Cluster headaches are intense attacks on one side and usually occur during sleep and can be accompanied by a red, tearing eye.",
